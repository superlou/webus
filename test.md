This one contains $math = \alpha_{test}$.

The following style (example1) will work as expected <div custom-style="example1">this works
 great</div> however when using span tags the style will be defined again, overriding the previous
 as you can see<span custom-style="example2">this doesn't work great</span>. This makes me sad :(

<div custom-style="metadata">REQ-134, Trace: C-421, C-23, C-101</div>
